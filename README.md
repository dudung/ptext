# ptext
Physics text


# About
ptext is a project to display physics using only text to save bandwidth and
it will be rendered in client side using JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets. Bandwidth saving is triggered by work from home (WFH) due corona virus pandemic (Covid-19) that hapens all around the world.

It is planned that it will have abilities such as [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org),
[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org), [Three.js](https://threejs.org), but
with simple markup language as [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com).
Actually, there was [butiran.js](https://github.com/dudung/butiran.js)
followed by [jsxPhys.js](https://github.com/dudung/jsxphys), where
the last can make tables and its references.
