# All in plain text
Is it not beautiful that all text, code, equation, chart, graphic, video, sound, and animation can be written and sent as text, then rendered in user side. It can save bandwidth in transferring data over the net. Expecially in our condition work from home (WHF) due to pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) all around the wold.

With our recent technology actually we can transfer any form of information through internet but when all people do the same thing, especially in a region with not so good communication infrastructure, then small high density information is preferable. Even the pText is still far away from that, but the idea is simple. All type of media must be able to be represented in text form, e.g. graphics should be in vector form and sound should be in only the form of most pronounced components from the Fourier transform (FT).
