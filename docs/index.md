# About
ptext is a project to display physics using only text to save bandwidth and it will be rendered in client side using JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets. It plans to have abilities such as [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org), [Three.js](https://threejs.org), but with simple markup language as [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com). Actually, there was [butiran.js](https://github.com/dudung/butiran.js) followed by [jsxPhys.js](https://github.com/dudung/jsxphys), where the last can make tables and its references.
