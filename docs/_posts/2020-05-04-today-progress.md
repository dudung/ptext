Actually, I only put note about emoji to this repo. Most of my time is for creating four other repos. It is not a good progress for this repo today.

Equation has been tested again, such as $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ in README.md of those repos and all do not work.

Code inserting do work. And I learn about emoji such as :x:, :heavy_check_mark:, and others. The emojis do not work in blog using Jekyll but can be previewed when online edittin in Github. Do not understand that.

The jemoji is add according to [this instruction](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/emoji-on-github-pages), by putting following lines

```yml
plugins:
  - jemoji
  ```

in ``_config.yml`` file

Must install gem, using this [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/10-deployment/) then it is solved.
