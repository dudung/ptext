Learn from [Albert-László Barabási's book chapter - 10 Spreading Phenomena](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/10#epidemic) about SI model, that epidemic models
* classify individuals in one of three states of compartments (S - susceptible, I - infectious, R - recovered),
* assumes of homogenous mixing (anynone can infect anyone else or chance of contact is the same for all individuals),
