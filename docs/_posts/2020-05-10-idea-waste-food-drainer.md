Try to figure out how to collect kitchen waste food for further process.

## Recent related products
Kitchen waste can be stored for a short time using plastic bag or fabric strainer supported by a [plactic structure](https://global.rakuten.com/en/store/zakkashop/item/19340) or for longer time it can be stored in a [box with smell reduction](https://www.josephjoseph.com/en-rw/stack-4). But for wet vegetable waste, [simpler device](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32619746043.html) can be used. There is also [another type](https://jackmacry.com/products/sink-suction-cup-rack) with multi purpose use. 

## Proposed design
A new type of device for draining wet waste food from kitchen activity is needed. It should be simple, odorless, dry the waste properly for further process in garden, easy to discharege and clean, eye-catching, and looks green.

Perhaps it is too much, but at least I am still able to dream :smile:, am not I?
