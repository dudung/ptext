Try to include MathJax in the post.

At least it has been tried, even then it was not success.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:law-gas-ideal}
pV = nRT
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:law-gas-ideal} is interesting to discuss.

Or Einstein field equations

$$ R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1} {2}Rg_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = \frac{8\pi G} {c^4}T_{\mu \nu} $$

Newton's law of universal gravitation

$$ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2} {r^2} $$
